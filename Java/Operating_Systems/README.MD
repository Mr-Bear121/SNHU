    Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
    
    in CS-230, our topic was creating a gaming room client. We had to listen to our client and create a program for a game called, "Draw it or loose it".
    They required a software system that would allow for a rapid loading and processing of a large amount of images and a fast gaming interface.
    The game was imagined to be distributed over many machines over many instances. The purpose of this was to allow access to the game from any location around the world.
    as well as many types of devices such as Android and IOS. Thus, we needed to consider: storage, memory management, distribution systems and security as
    core considerations when designing our program.
    What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
    
    When developing this documentation, I believe that aspects that I did well in was the distillation of requirements.
    when dealing with clients and assignments in general. It is often difficult to analyse and summeries requirements and code.
    Many times, when dealing with code and clients, You get lost in the details and take on too much extrenious information.
    It is good to know how to come back to what is important in an assignment and stick to that.

    What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

    When working through design documents, It is beneficial to simply read and understand them as an excercise.
    Many times, design documents are complicated and difficult to understand. However, understanding them is a necessary
    in order to complete a task. In short,I found all aspects of working through design documents as helpful since it promotes
    analytical abilities.

    If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

    If there is a section of these documents that I would like to revise in the future. It would be memory allocation. 
    From my work with C++, I can tell that memory allocation is a blind spot for me. I require more practice and research into this topic.
    However, once enacted, it will yield dividents to all my projects and knowledge.

    How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

    By interpreting the user`s needs. It allowed me to focus on the core requirements of the program first. This allowed me to know where to place most of my effort first.
    Afterwards, I could design the rest of my code around these core functions that had been thoroughly tested.

    How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

    My approach was to first analyse the requirements of the client, research based on those requirements, design my system, enact, test and deploy.
    in the future, I may rely more on Unit Testing and itterative design patterns. This will help me, "test as I go" when coding my programs.
