The following software focuses on creating a contact service and creating Unit Tests associated with them.

The software requirements for these services were outlined beforehand.

I created a contact object and a contact service as the application I was testing.

In order to address possible security concerns associated with this application. 

I created a statement to filter out incorrect input such as no first name or name too long.

The point of checking for things such as is the name too long is to prevent hacking attempts such as SQL Injection Attacks.

Such hacking methods would leave our application vulerable to and it is always best to address such issue sooner rather than later.


When writing these JUnit Test, I tried to keep them short and simple. 

To do this I used very little coding logic and made sure to use the methods and objects that I created.

When creating these tests I made sure to mentally break down the code I had written into parts and I tested each part individually.

when testing, I realized that I had created some silly mistakes and quickly corrected them. Such mistakes include using less than rather than greater than signs.

However, Those tests helped me locate and eliminate the problem in a timely manner and continue on in my work.
