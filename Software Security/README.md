    Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and its software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did the company want you to address?
      Artemis Financial Is a banking institution that was trying to incorperate addition security apparatuses into their existing banking applications
      
    What did you do well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall well-being?
    
      It was enjoyable to go through my client`s code and business infrastructure. Understanding an organization from the top down first helps me to understand the end goal before I start fixing things from the bottom up.
      That being said, testing from a dynamic point of view helped to understand the flow of data within an application. To code securely, one has to ask the question, "what would happen if someone inputted the opposite of what I want".
      you may even ask the question of how can my application be abused. Once you ask this question, you will naturally start to create cases in your mind revolving around how someone could hack into your code and you correct such problems as you
      require. If you do not do this, you will find very quickly that your application could legally ruin your life and the company your working for`s life.
      
    How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?

      I increased the security layers by generating an OWASP Report about the libraries and dependencies associated with several of Artemis Financials programs. OWASP reports identify vulnerabilities due to out of date Libraries.
      In the future, penetration testing would be required in order to create a more well rounded security system for our applications.
      
    How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?

      As I created and reviewed code for Artemis, I ran debugs in order to test if all parts of their code was functional. Afterwards I ran Vulnerability Reports to make sure no new vulnerabilites were introduced into these systems.
      
    What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?

      Resources that my be helpful in the future are Unit Tests. If we create a system of automated testing, then we can debug large chunks of our program in minutes rather than hours.
      
    Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
    
      The work that I would showcase would be my Cryptography work. I would showcase my hashfunction and how I used it to send data over a server.
